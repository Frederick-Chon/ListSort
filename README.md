# ListSort

ListSort is a sortable list project that focuses on using HTML's Drag and Drop API. The goal of this project is to become accustomed to using the drag and drop API with high order array methods to create a smooth sortable list. Users are presented with the 10 richest people in random order and will be able to drag and drop into different positions.
